spigot-dev-env is a series of python scripts I wrote to improve the workflow of programmers creating multi-version Minecraft plugins using NMS.

The main script automatically compiles all Spigot and CraftBukkit versions using Spigot's BuildTools - which will also install them all to your local maven repository (with NMS API included).
