Backed is a file backup system consisting of two parts: Backed-Site and Backed-SDK.

## Backed-Site
[GitHub](https://github.com/Ben-D-Anderson/Backed-Site)

Backed-Site is the website (frontend and backend) for the file backup system I made called Backed. It is security focused, fully encrypting user files and never storing them unencrypted on disk.

**Warning:** the project has long been abandonded and I believe is vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

Features:
- Account management
- MySQL integration
- REST API
- File management and cryptography
- Mailing

## Backed-SDK
[GitHub](https://github.com/Ben-D-Anderson/Backed-SDK)

Backed-SDK is the software development kit for the file backup system I made called Backed. The SDK interacts with the REST API in the website and creates user-friendly objects to be interacted with.

Features:
- Login as users
- Upload files
- Download files
- Delete files
- Get hashes of files
- List files
- Logout as users
