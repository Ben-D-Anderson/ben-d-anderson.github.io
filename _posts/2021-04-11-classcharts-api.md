ClassCharts API is an API that I made to easily interact with the student portion of the website "ClassCharts" through Java.

ClassCharts is a student management system used by many schools. Most commonly it is used to assign homework to students and manage behaviour.
<br />

Features of the API:
- Authenticate as a student
- Access and interact with student homeworks
- Access and interact with student timetable
